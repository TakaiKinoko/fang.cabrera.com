Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) has been one of the widely used linear models in time series forecasting during the past decades. Recent progress in machine learning has witnessed recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) gain popularity. This paper reviews in depth these three models and explores the efficacy of their application on foreign exchange rate prediction. Furthermore, sentiment analysis is incorporated into the LSTM model to show that there is correlation between sentiments extracted from historical news and currency exchanges.
