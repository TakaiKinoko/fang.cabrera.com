I just started a tech blog where I record some cool stuff I've learnt recently. It could've been another page attached to this website but I have some Google domains to use... these squatters, I know!

So please check it out here at [nichijou.co](http://nichijou.co/).

You're probably looking at the picture on the right and wondering how it has anything to do with a tech blog. Well, it doesn't! Haha. I just thought [my husband](https://buymecoffee.co/edgarbenjamincabrera/) looks cute ^.^
